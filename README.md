- This is a repo that I tried to follow and modifiy some codes while taking a lecture.
    - The original code from lecture doesn't use smart pointers and STL containers
    - I tried to use smart pointers and ComPtr for easier memory management (but little bit slow in runtime)
    - I also use STL containers in some data structures for easier resource management (this also makes little bit slow in runtime)
